Welcome to my Data Warehouse and Analytics Project! ðŸš€
This project walks through the entire processâ€”from setting up a data warehouse to digging into the data and pulling out insights that actually matter.
I built this as a portfolio piece to show what Iâ€™ve learned and how I apply best practices in both data engineering and analytics.

**Bronze Layer:** This is where the raw data landsâ€”straight from the source systems, without any changes. In this project, I pulled in data from CSV files and loaded it into a SQL Server database.

**Silver Layer:** Hereâ€™s where the cleanup happens. I worked on cleaning, standardizing, and normalizing the data to get it ready for meaningful analysis.

**Gold Layer:** This is the final, business-ready version. I organized the data into a star schema, making it easy to use for reporting and analytics.

**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

This project covers a few key areas:

**Data Architecture:** I designed a modern data warehouse using the Medallion Architecture with Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.

**ETL Pipelines:** Built end-to-end pipelines to extract data from source files, transform it, and load it into the warehouse.

**Data Modeling:** Created fact and dimension tables that are optimized for running analytical queries efficiently.

**Analytics & Reporting:** Used SQL to build reports and dashboards that turn data into clear, actionable insights.

**PROJECT REQUIREMENTS**

Building a Data Warehouse

**Objective:**
Design and implement a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to bring together sales data for better reporting and data-driven decision-making.

**Key Details:**

**Source Data**: Work with CSV files representing ERP and CRM systems.

**Data Preparation:** Clean and address any data quality issues before moving into analysis.

**Data Integration:** Merge the two sources into a unified, analysis-ready data model.

**Project Scope:** Limit the focus to the most recent datasetâ€”no need for historical tracking.

**Documentation:** Include clear, easy-to-follow documentation of the data model for both business users and analytics teams.
